While native English speakers may appear to speak quickly, they achieve this fluency by connecting words together smoothly rather than pronouncing each syllable separately. They may omit certain syllables, add sounds to create transitions, and contract smaller words to make speech easier and faster.

Specifically, the video highlights techniques such as:

* Connecting words together without pauses (e.g., "What do you do?" becomes "What doyoudo?")
* Pronouncing "the" as "thuh" (e.g., "What's the weather today?" becomes "What's thuh weather today?")
* Inserting a "d" sound between words ending in "t" and beginning with "d" (e.g., "What do you do?" becomes "What doyoudo?")
* Omitting the "t" sound in words that have a "t" in the middle (e.g., "daughter" becomes "daughder").

By adopting these techniques, learners can speak English more fluently and naturally, as well as improve their comprehension of native speakers' speech.
